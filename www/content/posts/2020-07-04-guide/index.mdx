### Why we should build our website?
There are many services out there to build a website easily. Just drag and drop then you can have a good website in less than 1 hour. Just you need to pay a bit of money.

But I chose to build my website because:

#### I can experiment new things.
I love web. I know basic CSS and HTML, so I always to to see it live in my website.

#### I can customize and add any thing I like.
I embed my Instagram post and built my work gallery. If I use a service, I can’t do things like this.

#### In a long run, it’s easy to maintain.
Because the code is built in component level. When we change that component, every else will be updated accordingly.
